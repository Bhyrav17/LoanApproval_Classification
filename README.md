<h3> Loan Approval Prediction </h3>

<h2> 1.1 General Info </h2>
    Loan approval from a distinguished bank or any other is subject to a lot of constraints and processes. Many individuals with a great credit history and proper documentation do not get approval due to this heavy and long process. The 5 basic steps to applying for a loan are listed below:
   <p> 1. Application & Required Information is gathered and submitted. <br>
    2. Loan Underwriting <br>
    3. Decision & Pre-Closing <br>
    4. Closing <br>
    5. Post Closing<br>
   </p>

<h2> 1.2 What is the problem? </h2>
  
  The Loan approval  is a tedious process which requires lots of background checks and documentation before it is sanctioned. The time frame for approval is between a month or so depending on the applicant's submission of the required documents and checks. 
  
  In order to speed up the process for this approval/rejection of loans to an applicant, we can use the latest tech to build a ML model with accuracy. 
 

<h2> 1.3 Interested Party and Reason </h2>
   As mentioned in the problem statement, the intended user for this ML model would be the banks. As they are always approached for loans, they are the ones to benefit from this model. This model would save the bank an ample amount of time when approving the loans. After getting all the required data from the applicant, they just have to feed in this data to the model and they would have a decision of approval/rejection of loans.
    

 Advantages of having a ML model with Loan approval prediction powers:
  >- The Banks will have accurate model which would either approval  .
  >- Based on the above information, the bank can take appropriate actions in order to identify to whom the loan can be approved with due diligence. 
  >- The model will help cut down the process time for loan approval approval/rejection which will attract new customers to the bank as they have less wait time for processing the loan.
